Version 1.2.2: November 29th 2015
- For SuperRes, HLSL Bicubic downscaler is broken and has been disabled. Downscaling is now done in AviSynth
- There will be a performance hit and it will take a lot more memory, but the image will be good. Until HLSL Bicubic is fixed.

Version 1.2.1: November 28th 2015
- Fixed distortion bug introduced in last version when using PrecisionIn=1
- SuperRes, Super-xBR and ColorMatrix now use PrecisionIn=2 until the bug is corrected

Version 1.2: November 26th 2015
- Added precisionIn and precisionOut arguments to ExecuteShader, allowing converting data on the GPU
- SuperRes, Super-sBR and ColorMatrix scripts adapted to convert with precision=1 while doing the processing with precision=2
- Removed D3DCREATE_DISABLE_PSGP_THREADING flag from DirectX9 device
- Performance is similar, memory usage is slightly lower and CPU usage is considerably lower

Version 1.1: November 24th 2015
- Shader will now attempt open relative paths in the same folder as the DLL.
- Folder argument removed from SuperRes and Super-xBR. CSO files must be in the same folder as Shader.dll
- Added ColorMatrix.avsi for high bit dept color matrix conversion to avoid banding
- SuperRes now has srcMatrix601 argument allowing to convert color matrix while running SuperRes with no performance cost.
